# `git-and-github`

This repository contains practice materials for [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://info5940.infosci.cornell.edu/syllabus/git-and-github/).

There are two relevant files:

- `gun-deaths.Rmd` - an R Markdown file containing a basic report on the `rcfss::gun_deaths` data frame
- `gun-deaths.R` - an R script reproducing the same analysis as in the Rmd file
